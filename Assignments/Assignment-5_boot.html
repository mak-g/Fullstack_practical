    <p style="background-color: lightskyblue;">Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. It contains CSS- and (optionally) JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components.Bootstrap is the seventh-most-starred project on GitHub, with more than 142,000 stars, behind freeCodeCamp (almost 312,000 stars) and marginally behind Vue.js framework.[2] According to Alexa Rank, Bootstrap is in the top-2000 in the USA while vuejs.org is in the top-7000 in the USA.Bootstrap, originally named Twitter Blueprint, was developed by Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton at Twitter as a framework to encourage consistency across internal tools. Before Bootstrap, various libraries were used for interface development, which led to inconsistencies and a high maintenance burden.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrap_(front-end_framework)" target="_blank">click here</a></p>
